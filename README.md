 I graduated from Denison University in 2022 with Bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Data Analytics. Right now, I'm a student of MS in Security Informatics at Johns Hopkins University.

## My interests include but are not limited to:
    1) Data Processing and Visualization
    2) Counterfactual and Fairness Analysis in Finance
    3) Machine Learning (Especially in Intrusion Detection, LLM, Adversarial ML, Audio Processing and Generation, and Reinforcement Learning.)
    4) Web Development
    5) Information Retrieval
   
## Work Experience
   #### Data Engineer Intern | YunChang Technology Co., Ltd (NebulaJoy)
   1) Created a Python-based web scraping framework, saving 10 hours weekly in manual data collection for market research, aggregating data from 8000+ mobile games (2010-2020).
   2) Developed a data pipeline for processing and integrating 300GB+ data from multiple sources
   3) Built an automated data platform that automates data queries and periodic report
   4) Implemented RFM and Kmeans models to enhance user targeting, increasing Day-1 retention by 23% and average ad views per user by 16%.
   5) Utilized NLP techniques to automate game category classification to eliminate manual labeling.
   6) Developed a parkour game demo, optimizing performance and reducing frame rate drops by 30%.
   7) Optimized object instantiation and recycling, reducing memory usage by 20% and improving game performance.
     
   #### Software Engineer Intern | Wuhan KuYou World Technology Co., Ltd
   1) Constructed user portraits and analyzed user in-game behaviors by using RFM and Kmeans++ models
   2) Adjusted the gameplay and contents by comparing multiple versions of the product with the A/B Test model in order to improve
   3) Summarized game market data and visualized it to form an automated weekly dashboard by Power BI.
   4) Developed an internal website by Django to summarize the internal data of each department in the company and follow up of the project process

## Research Experience
#### Research Assistant | The Johns Hopkins University - Carey Business School | Dec 2022 - Present 
Collaborated with Dr. Sudip Gupta to address financial problems towards alternative credit rating, credit derivatives, and treasury auctions. Utilized machine learning techniques and fairness testing to enhance credit applicant identification, eliminate bias, and improve model reliability.
1) Analyzed the potential replacement of conventional credit scores with mobile/social footprint data using XG Boost, Random Forest, and ANN
2) Identified bias and unfair decisions from causal modeling in trained models through rigorous fairness tests.
3) Leveraged Variational Autoencoder to build a fairness prediction model that eliminated correlations between sensitive features (sex and age) and observable features (house and job).
4) Effectively addressing fairness concerns and enhancing model reliability.
5) Employed Ensemble Learning to generate simulation data by discerning behaviors of approved and default borrowers.
6) Implemented Reinforcement learning to optimize loan approval strategies and minimize defaults.

#### Research Assistant | The Johns Hopkins University - Whiting Engineering School | Sep 2022 - Feb 2023 
Collaborated with Dr. Xiangyang Li to improve the adversarial ML attacks on spam email classifier.
1) Built spam email classifiers with NLP techniques, optimizing false negative rates through adversarial ML attacks.
2) Apply cosine similarity to compare words before and after perturbation by PGD attack to identify ‚Äútop good words‚Äù.
3) Achieved an 8% increase in the success rate of the decision tree model compared to previous methods.
  
#### Summer Research Scholar | Denison University | 2019 Summer & 2020 Summer
    



## Projects
#### Innovations on vision-language pre-trained (VLP) model 
1) Built a VLP model with a shortcut re-weighting technique to improve the ability of Vision Model through PyTorch
2) Integrated ViT and BERT and trained with salient masking techniques to maximize the utilization of computation.
3) Leveraging Slurm to allocate computing resources, processed 14 million images and text, and conducted five experiments three downstream tasks with eight A100 GPUs to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model.
4) The Final model exhibits marginally superior performance compared to the baseline model by 1.4%.
     
#### Discount notification system 
1) Created Amazon SQS services and EKS clusters with AWS CLI
2) Deployed a data distribution system in Kubernetes Pods with designated AWS IAM roles for queue access.
3) Constructed a data ingestion service with‚Äù Dealmoon‚Äù API to send, parse, and store messages in DynamoDB.
4) Established error handling, retry mechanisms, monitoring, and logging for EKS clusters and SQS queues.
     
#### Encrypted mobile devices network traffic recognition of application type and VPN usage  
   * Simulate actual manipulations by Selenium in Python for six different applications to generate network traffic data.  
   * Captured and processed ten gigabytes of network packets, converted the pcap to JSON and stored them in MongoDB
   * Built a classifier utilizing BiLSTM+Attention for temporal and 1D-CNN for spatial feature extraction.
   * The precision of application identification and VPN identification reached 93.7% and 88.4% respectively.
     

#### Text summarization of Covid-19 tweets and bot detection using NLP techniques Learning [Fall 2021]
    * Leveraged LDA and Sequence-to-Sequence model to realize the text summarization of COVID-19 tweets.
    * Observed the pattern between  rumor and non-rumor tweets  through Sentimental Analysis via NLTK package.
    * Trained Logistic Regression, KNN, and SVM models to identify bots and rumors by scikit-learn. 
 

## Currently, I'm working on...

#### Intrusion Detection System of Smart Power Grid
* Construct a test bed that simulates the physical characteristics, behaviors of a Smart Power Grid System, and types of attack scenarios for training and testing the intrusion detection models.
* Create a comprehensive threat model that aligns with the specific functions and characteristics of a power grid and implement ML models capable of processing real-time data streams from the power.
* Employ model distillation techniques to enhance model interpretability, making it easier to pinpoint the source and nature of anomalies.
* Introduce an alerting module to provide a concise diagnosis, pinpointing the functional area of the power grid where anomalies occur to expedite the diagnosis process and augment the network resistance.
