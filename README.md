I graduated from Denison University in 2022 with majors Data analytics and Computer Science. Right now, I'm a master student of Security Informatics of Johns Hopkins University.

## My academic interest includes but not limited to:
    1) Data Visualization
    2) Regression Analysis
    3) Machine Learning (Especially in Unsupervised Learning for Anomaly Detection and muti-agents reinfocement learning.)

## I also spent time at:
   * 2019 Summer research program in Denison University worked with Dr.Dogucu.  
   (**Topic:** An interactive web application made by ShinyApp for policing Data)
   * 2020 Summer research program in Denison University worked with Dr.Villanueva.  
   (**Topic:** How dose Brexit impact on Wage and Manufacturing of UK economy )
   
## Work Experience
   #### Product Data Scientist (Internship) of WuHanZhongYu Information Technology Co., Ltd (MPMF)
   *  Constructed user portraits and analyzed user in game behaviors by using RFM and Kmeans++ models  
   *  Adjusted the gameplay and contents by comparing multiple versions of the product with AB Test model in order to improve 
   *  Summarized game market data and visualized it to form an automated weekly dashboard by Power BI.
   *  Developed an internal website by Django to summarize the internal data of each department in the company and follow-up of the project process
   
   #### Data Engineer (Internship) of Beijing YunChang Game Technology Co., LTD.
   * Data collection, cleaning, and visualization of the game market. 
   * Participated in the user data mining of the internal beta version of the Ghost Cry Peak Battle Project. Leveraged the 5W2H model and decisin tree to extract the characteristics of usersâ€™ game behaviors. 

## Projects
#### Cooperative behavior in Muti-Agents Symmetrical Self-Training Reinforcement Learning [Spring 2022]
    * Designed the experiment based on the Dodge-ball game environment in Unity 3D.
    * Applied traditional PPO algorithm to train agents by symmetric adversarial self-training. The agents showed cooperative behavior in the self-curriculum learning staged. 

#### Data-driven Advise on Dawes Arboretum's Future Operations [Fall 2021]  
   * Provided data-driven advice to users-Dawes Arboretum to increase the number of tourists and the number of passes purchased, and conducted data cleaning and web scraping by Python.  
   * Used F-test to verify whether the temperature would affect the number of visited tourists,linear regression to simulate the impact of temperature changes on the number of visits by members and non-members, and tableau 

#### Text summarization of Covid-19 tweets and bot detection using NLP techniques Learning [Fall 2021]
    * Leveraged LDA and Sequence-to-Sequence model to realize the text summarization of COVID-19 tweets.
    * Observed the pattern between  rumor and non-rumor tweets  through Sentimental Analysis via NLTK package.
    * Trained Logistic Regression, KNN, and SVM models to identify bots and rumors by scikit-learn. 
 
    
## Currently, I'm working on....
#### Adversarial Email Generation against Spam Detection Models 
    * Optimizing feature engineering process by introducing Euclidean distance to compare the changes between the vectors in the original emails and vectors in adversarial emails attacked by PGD.
    
#### Generate loan approval policies by combining credit scoring and social footprints with reinforcement learning
